description: Scientific literature is becoming more and more important as our everyday lives become increasingly enmeshed with technological innovation. However, with more that 30 millon citations in the medical literature (Pubmed) alone, understanding what literature to read and what to ignore is a major barrier.

Essentially building your understanding by reading the works of an actual scientific community.
